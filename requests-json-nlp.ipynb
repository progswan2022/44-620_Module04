    "* For Charlotte Bronte's \"Life\", I agree with the polarity score. While the poem does speak of the laments of life, there is an over-arching positive tone; taking the good with the bad, but ultimately exclaiming that courage can overcome the despair. The Sentiment analysis agrees closely with me due to positive words such as 'victoriously' and 'gloriously'\n",
    "* For Shakespear's \"Under The Greenwood Tree\", I slightly disagree with the Sentiment analysis as I believe this poem to be more positive. I believe the issue lies partially in the Olde English prose; written in meters which causes certain words to be used when they normally wouldn't and the shortening of words through apostrophes, which I imagine is confusing if the NPL hasn't been trained on Shakespear\n",
    "* For Edgar Allan Poe's \"Silence\", I don't necessarily agree with the polarity score but I am also having a difficult time discerning the tone of the poem myself. My guess is that the more negative words than positive are what caused the score\n",
    "* For Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\", I don't necessarily gree with the positive polarity score. The author is in mourning and Ravens are often regarded as symbols for death. I believe the sentiment is more mournful, which could be thought of as negative."
